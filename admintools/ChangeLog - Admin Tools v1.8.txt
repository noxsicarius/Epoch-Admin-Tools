New Feature:
Admin Fast Build: allows fast base building when toggled on in AdminMode.
Added a secondary weapons menu.
Added a gear menu.
Function Key support. There is now a file: FunctionKeys.sqf that can be customized!

Bug Fix:
Fixed a bit of the desync/lag caused with zombie shield.
Teleporting no longer teleports you into the air if you are in an air vehicle with the engine off. If your engine is on it will still teleport you up to prevent tree collision.
